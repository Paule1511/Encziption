The Concept is an idea of Combining Encryption and Data Compression using Steganographical Methods


### The Concept

Using Seeds for Encrypting and Compressing Files into a file as small as possible.

As example compressing 10 Bytes into 1 Byte using a Seed which decides the Starting and Step. End Decided by algorithm. one decides using an "EOF" Byte and one could be decided by the seed it self.

[[Small Example for Encryption using a Seed]]

Multi-Algorithm Compatibility for using many compression and encryption possibilitys using the Seed method. (In case someone finds faster/more Secure Steganographical Algorithms)



### Theoretical Possibilitys


File Compression to a minimum using Default Seeds (as Example: 1-1000)
